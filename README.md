# AI Systems Gateway — Vector Partitioning & Hot Shard Prevention

This repository contains a FastAPI gateway in front of a vector database (Qdrant).
It demonstrates shard-aware routing, hot-shard prevention using XOR spread,
fanout-based search, and adaptive fanout retry.

> Work in progress. Architecture decisions and experiments are documented separately.
